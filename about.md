I am a doctorial student in the Department of Educational Psychology at the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/). I basically use this site to show my recent, current, and future work as well as some tutorials in a way that tries to make my efforts more interactive. 

My research interests are focused on the development of psychometric and general quantitative methods, as applied in the psychological, educational, and social sciences. I am now Graduate Teaching Assisstant of Multivariate Statistics.
