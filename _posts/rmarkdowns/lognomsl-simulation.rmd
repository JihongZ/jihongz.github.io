```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Simulate lognomal distibution
This is to simulation lognormal distribution

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(20171108)

#### Give Y mean and Y sd, simluate lognormal distribution data.
m = 891 # geometric mean
sd = 490 # geometric sd
v = sd^2
phi = sqrt(v + m^2) 

mu    = log(m^2/phi) # log mean
sigma = sqrt(log(1+v/m^2)) # log sd
  

y <- rlnorm(n = 200000, mu, sigma) %>% round(0)
mean(y) # should be close to 891
sd(y) # should be close to 490

plot(density(y))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
