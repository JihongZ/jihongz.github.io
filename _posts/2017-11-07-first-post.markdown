This is my first post. Next several years, I'll use github.io to post what I think is interesting in R programming. I found it is great to learning Statistics by post what I learn periodly.

For example, this is the R code:
{% highlight ruby %}
string <- "This is R programming"
print string
{% endhighlight %}
